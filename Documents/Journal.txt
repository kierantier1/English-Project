November 14, 2017
-comparing ScrMenu and ScrPlay to determine any errors that would prevent it from being run
-forgot to set the inputprocessor to (this), that fixed the hit detection errors on play
-Changing isHit() back to a boolean method, more scaleable that way
-gamMenu.updateState() works, I had to use the gamMenu, not the GamMenu.  gamMenu was declared inside the
