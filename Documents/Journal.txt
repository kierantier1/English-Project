October 31, 2017

-getting a NullPointerException when running ButtonMenu, investigating...

November 6, 2017
-still unable to run ButtonMenu on ScrGameover, where the hit detection code is

November 7, 2017
-Mr Grondin reviewed Status Report 3 and went over the code, and moved all of the declarations from create() to show(), and now it works.
-Now to make hit detection work

November 8, 2017
-updating every screen to show a sprite, implementing hit detection tomorrow

November 9, 2017
-Cleaned up the Screens to prepare them for hit detection
-trying to implement hit detection on Game Over Screen

November 10, 2017
-trying to put 2 buttons on GameOver, cleaned up the Play sprite

November 13, 2017
-There are now 2 buttons on GameOver, hit detection on both, but UpdateState on the methods results in error, listed below
-non-static method updateState(int) cannot be referenced from a static context
-starting to implement hit detection on ScrMenu
-screen play and options are having errors parsing the file
-the Play Screen doesn't detect hits

November 14, 2017
-comparing ScrMenu and ScrPlay to determine any errors that would prevent it from being run
-forgot to set the inputprocessor to (this), that fixed the hit detection errors on play
-Changing isHit() back to a boolean method, more scaleable that way
-gamMenu.updateState() works, I had to use the gamMenu, not the GamMenu.  gamMenu was declared inside the 

// New Copy:  MenuButton2 //

November 24, 2017
-made a new copy of MenuButton to experiment with a Button Class

November 25, 2017
-Creating a Button class, working on understanding inheritance

November 26, 2017
-The Button class isn't working, unsure how to fix it
-Adding pictures to each of the screens to show the User which screen they're on

November 28, 2017

-Shows error in Screen when calling Button, but works properly

November 29, 2017
-Button Class implemented on all screens
-Worked on implementing isHit() on button, unsure how to proceed.
-At home, thinking about starting the exhibition
-Creating a class for movable man

November 30, 2017
-Trying to put a Dude class in Play screen, but it doesn't want to accept the class, "Can't Find"
-Ignoring Dude class for now, hit detection between sprites is not on play screen
-Made the dude into a Button, because it's basically a sprite with less lines

December 1, 2017
-Adding walls from last year into Play Screen
-Tried to make new Class for Wall, it doesn't recognize it (again)

December 4, 2017
-Trying to make Wall Class, still doesn't recognize symbol :(

December 5, 2017
-Asking Grondin about Class problems
-Fixed, not declaring class properly, wall class now works
-Looking at Bradley's code for hints on how to do Animation
-For some reason, Dude and Wall class declarations are still being considered errors, despite working properly

December 6, 2017
-Picking apart Bradley's code for Animation help
-Made a spritesheet for Animation, cloned brad's code to gitHub in order to work on Animation @ home

December 11, 2017
-Actually starting to merge Animation code from brad's code
-not working as of yet, working more on it.

December 13, 2017
-Going to split off animation as a different project

December 19, 2017
-Coming back from animation for a while, working on a Text Box that shows up when you hit a sign
-Probably going to make a class for it

December 20, 2017
-Text box means BitmapFont, which means upside-down text.  Can't flip it, but I can put the text right into the box sprite
-Hit detection for Sign implemented, can only trigger sign once per hit
-Sign is working properly.  Only appears when player hits the sign

January 8, 2018
-Coming back from break, making QOL changes, ie making all 3 buttons on each screen.  Easier to navigate
-As a principle, try to put Menu in the middle bottom for consistency
-All buttons are on all screens, am going to move text box on ScrSign, because it's in the way of the button.
-Saved a textbox Template to my drive, edit that in PS whenever there's a new box.  It's tedious, but Bitmapfont doesn't work with OC

January 9, 2018
-Made a quit button on the Menu screen

January 11, 2018
-Beginning to merge Animation into the ScrAnimation screen
-Animation Screen merged successfully
-Tomorrow:  new spritesheet?

January 12, 2018
-I am unable to move Button, Wall and Dude classes to a Classes folder, why not??
-Next Steps:  Creating a new application:  merging animation and Hit detection

January 15, 2018
-I don't really want to create a whole new application, so I'm just making a new Screen, AniHit
-Going to add Quit and Anihit buttons to each screen

January 16, 2018
-More button adding
-Moved the walls on the play screen to accomodate Quit and AniHit buttons
-Walls and isHitS function implemented in AniHit screen
-Hit detection works in AniHit, but I cannot change the starting position of the Sprite.  What the heck

January 17, 2018
-Animation is still being drawn in the top right corner, unsure why
-Using a ghost sprite underneath animation for hit detection.
-Using sprTest.setPosition during declaration fixed the issue
-The little map sprite I created isn't fixing its position properly when I scale it for the walls

January 18, 2018
-Making the sign on ScrSign have more text, editing pngs
-Yeah boye it finally works.  Run into the sign, shows you sign text 1.  Press enter while hitting the sign, shows you sign text 2.

January 19, 2018
-Making a more polished "Game" screen, incorporating all previous screens.
-"Game" screen in place, implementing buttons
-When you make the page bigger, the buttons don't work.  Why??
-Some next steps for ScrGame
    -Adding a sign to ScrGame
    -Making a house sprite, making it like the sign, you hit the door, it asks you if you want to proceed.
    -If so, it takes you to a new screen, inside the house

January 22, 2018
-Starting to implement door/house thing
-House sprite is in place, relocates to scrMenu right now, until I can put a House screen in place
-Trying to make a new Screen, ScrHouse, but it doesn't want to switch to the screen.

January 23, 2018
-Copy/pasting scrAniHit into scrHouse to test, to see if the code I had in scrHouse was the problem, not the code I had to switch in scrGame
-That's not it, checking scrGame for problems
-Whoops I forgot some steps on GamMenu, works now
-Walls and floor in place for ScrHouse, Hit detection for door works
-I made the little dude face the direction he would be had he actually gone through the door :)
-Tomorrow: Make the table a collision object?

January 24, 2018
-Starting to put together project
